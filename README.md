# Gravitys-Great-Betrayal
A "3D platformer where you can change the direction of gravity" I made for my last project on my Games Development Level 3 course. This one didn't undergo any major design decisions but as always, plenty of things had to be cut due to time constraints.

# How to Run
I think there are some issues related to controller latency in the [WebGL build](https://hedgehog125.github.io/hedgehog125/Gravitys-Great-Betrayal/), but it works fine apart from that.

As always, I'd recommend the native builds, which you can find in the releases tab or on [itch.io](https://hedgehog125.itch.io/gravitys-great-betrayal).

# Building and Modifying
The game uses Unity version 2022.1.16f1. Also note that I ignored the lightmaps in Git, so you'll need to bake them yourself.
